## Project Overview

The script uses Python and the `python-docx` library to generate a structured CV. It includes the following stages:

1. **Dockerized Introduction**: Simulate a Dockerfile-style intro to introduce your professional persona.
2. **Skills Deployment**: Present your skills in a YAML-like format as if describing a Kubernetes deployment.
3. **Work History**: Simulate an automation log-style representation of your professional experience.
4. **Certifications**: Highlight your certifications related to cloud and security.
5. **Demos**: Simulate automation demonstrations for GitLab CI/CD.
6. **Cloud Services**: Discuss your cloud experience, particularly with Azure, and include leadership qualities.

This project emphasizes not only your technical expertise but also demonstrates how automation and AI/ML can be integrated to optimize various processes, like CV generation.
